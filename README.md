# DataScienceProjects
The home for all my data science projects

I may divy this up in the future, depending on how many projects I get going in here.

Descriptions of projects: 

Edmonton Housing:
  I have used this analysis as an entry into the University of Alberta Idea Fund in 2019, in which 
students are allowed to pursue any non-curricular activity with the intent to learn from it, not to profit from it.
I started the project with the intent to do machine learning on the dataset, and although I would still like to do that,
the time constraints of the Idea Fund presentation led me to only discuss the analysis portion of the project.

Credit Card Fraud, Crimes in Boston.
  I mainly used these as a learning opportunity, as these were the first datasets I took on myself. 
They are mainly for learning the different functionalities of libraries and understanding the ML workflow

Functions
  A central location for common miscellaneous function that I currently use or may use in the future.
